# Workflow — How to Handle Change Requests

This is the orchestration rule. When referenced, follow this process end-to-end.

## How to proceed — per task, in order
1. **Detect the session model** (statusline / session-model-guard injection): Fable 5 → strict
   orchestrator (never edit directly); Opus → planner in the main thread (micro-edit exception);
   anything else → follow this workflow as written.
2. **Map the task to delegates**: plan/design → `<domain>-architect` (Opus); code changes →
   `<domain>-coder` (Sonnet); tests → `testing-architect` / `testing-coder`; exploration/broad
   reads → Explore subagent (`model: "haiku"`).
3. **Write the brief** per the Brief contract (objective, exact paths, gathered findings,
   constraints, output format + word cap); reference plan files in `.claude/plans/` instead of
   pasting plan text.
4. **Dispatch** (in parallel when layers are independent), then **verify**: review the compact
   return, run {{TEST_COMMAND}}, confirm the diff is minimal before reporting done.

## Phase 1: Understand

1. **Read the files involved.** Understand what exists before proposing anything.
2. **Identify the layer.** Where does this change belong?
{{LAYER_MAP}}
3. **Identify the minimal change.** The least work that solves the problem, reusing existing
   helpers, services, components, and patterns. No refactors of surrounding code, no abstractions
   for one-off changes.

**Place it where it belongs (first time).** Put each new function in the layer that owns its concept from the start — don't inline logic that belongs to a deeper layer into a thin outer layer (controller, route, UI component, event handler) and refactor it into the owning layer later. Ask which layer owns the responsibility and put it there; outer layers stay thin and delegate. If the same logic would live at two or more call sites, give it a single home in the owning unit and have callers call it — never duplicate it. A scatter-then-extract "double take" means the placement decision was skipped.

## Phase 2: Plan

4. **State the problem and solution in plain language** before writing code — what's wrong, what
   changes, which files.
5. **Check for existing tests** covering the affected behavior. If none exist, suggest the right
   test type to the user and wait for their answer before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Execute with Sub-Agents

**Every code edit MUST go through a named sub-agent — no direct `Edit` / `Write` from the main
thread, even for one-line changes.** *(Opus session exception: a trivial single-file few-line edit
at a known location may be done directly — never on Fable.)* Writing/editing its own plan file
(`*.md` under `.claude/plans/`) is exempt from this rule on every model, Fable included. The main
thread plans and verifies only. Dispatch by layer:

{{DISPATCH_LIST}}

If a change spans multiple layers, dispatch the corresponding coders **in parallel** (single
message, multiple `Agent` tool calls), each with only the context relevant to its layer.

### What the main thread may do directly
- Read files (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`) within the reading discipline below
- Run read-only shell commands (git status/log/diff, tests, linters)
- Write plan files in plan mode and memory files
- Dispatch sub-agents

## Phase 4: Verify

- **Review what the sub-agents produced** — minimal, matches the plan, follows existing patterns,
  nothing unrelated touched.
- **Run the tests** for the affected area: {{TEST_COMMAND}}

## Session-model discipline

The main Claude thread is for synthesis, trade-offs, planning, and user interaction. Model tier
determines what the main thread may do directly.

### Fable 5 session (default — strict orchestrator)

Fable 5 is a pure orchestrator. It **never** calls `Edit` or `Write` directly — not even
one-liners, except its own plan file (`*.md` under `.claude/plans/`). Every code change goes
through a named Sonnet coder. Planning goes through an Opus architect. Broad exploration goes to a
Haiku sub-agent.

**Suggested flow per task:**
1. Fable 5: receive task, think about scope.
2. Haiku (`Explore`, `model: "haiku"`): broad mapping, returns a summary.
3. Fable 5: read 1–3 key files to verify what the plan hinges on.
4. Fable 5: write the plan, resolve trade-offs, interact with the user.
5. Sonnet (named coder): execute the plan.
6. Fable 5: verify the diff, run tests, report back.

#### Delegate to Haiku (`model: "haiku"`)
- Broad / unknown scope — "find every place that does X", "map this area"
- Large-file scans where only a pattern or a few snippets are needed
- Git archaeology across multiple files
- Cross-cutting greps that would flood the main context

#### Read directly from the main thread (Fable 5 only)
- Verifying a sub-agent's summary on any load-bearing claim
- Targeted reads of a known small file (1–3 files) where you know exactly what you need
- The plan file itself while iterating in plan mode

Reading sprees and mass greps in the main thread are a smell — more than a couple of exploratory
reads in a row means stop and dispatch an agent.

### Opus session

Opus keeps planning and architecture in the main thread. Delegate implementation to named Sonnet
coders and broad exploration to Haiku sub-agents.

**Micro-edit exception:** a trivial single-file, few-line edit at a known location may be done
directly from the Opus main thread. Never apply this exception on Fable 5. Writing or editing its
own plan file (`*.md` under `.claude/plans/`) is always allowed directly, Fable 5 included.

The domain architects (Opus by default) are Fable-upgradeable in non-Fable sessions only — when
the task explicitly says to use Fable, dispatch them with `model: "fable"` (dispatch-time override
beats the frontmatter default); in Fable 5 sessions architects always stay Opus — the
orchestrator's plan review is the Fable pass, never double-pay. Test planning
({{TEST_PLANNER_NAMES}}) is always Opus. Sonnet is reserved for execution by the named coders
({{CODER_NAMES}}).

## Token-efficient handoffs

### Brief contract (every Agent dispatch)
Every brief to a sub-agent must include:
1. **Objective** in 1–2 sentences.
2. **Exact file paths + line ranges** when known.
3. **All findings already gathered**, pasted in — the agent starts fresh and must not re-explore
   what is already known.
4. **Applicable constraints and conventions**.
5. **Required output format and word cap**.

"Go look around" briefs are forbidden when findings already exist.

### Return contract
`Result / Files changed (path:lines) / Deviations / Open questions`

- Coders: ≤200 words total; never paste diffs back.
- Explorers: ≤300 words; when findings exceed ~40 lines write them to `.claude/findings/<slug>.md`
  and return conclusions + path only.
- Architects: write the full plan to `.claude/plans/<task-slug>.md`; return only the path, a
  3–5 bullet summary, and open questions (≤10 lines total).

`.claude/plans/` and `.claude/findings/` are gitignored scratch space — safe to delete, prune
when stale (>1 week).

### No duplicate exploration
- Paste Haiku findings verbatim into architect/coder briefs — one distillation, not two rounds.
- Run parallel Haiku scans for independent areas (single message, multiple `Agent` calls).
- Prefer continuing an existing agent (`SendMessage`) over respawning a fresh one.

### Anti-patterns
- Whole-file `Read` when a line range suffices.
- `Grep` without `head_limit` in the main thread.
- Forwarding raw tool output instead of the distilled finding.
- Two agents exploring the same area.
- Spawning a fresh agent when the previous one can continue.

## Rules

- **Minimal changes only.** No comments, docblocks, or refactors on code you didn't need to change.
- **Use what exists.** Don't create new abstractions unless the task requires it.
- **Don't create files unnecessarily.** Prefer editing existing files.
- **Ask, don't assume.** Ambiguity or multiple valid approaches → ask the user first.
